## Load and check data

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Load packages

# Base Package
library('base')

# Visualization
library('ggplot2')
library('ggthemes')
library('scales')

# Data Manipulation
library('dplyr') 

# Imputation
library('mice') 

# Classification algorithm
library('randomForest') 
```

Now that our packages are loaded, let’s read in and take a peek at the data.

```{r}
train <- read.csv('./input/train.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)
test  <- read.csv('./input/test.csv', stringsAsFactors = F)

full  <- bind_rows(train, test) # bind training & test data

# check data
str(full)
```

We’ve got a sense of our variables, their class type, and the first few observations of each. We know we’re working with 1309 observations of 12 variables. To make things a bit more explicit since a couple of the variable names aren’t 100% illuminating, here’s what we’ve got to deal with:


```{r include=FALSE}
save(list=ls(),file = ".RData")
```
