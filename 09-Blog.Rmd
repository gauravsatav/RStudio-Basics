## Blog

It so often happens that we continue to learn new things and we tend to forget them due to one reasons like *Not having a chance to apply them regularly* or more. Maintaining a blog helps us to write in our own words what it is that we've learned and also it can help you showcase your knowledge to someone when asked upon.

**Blogdown** is an awesome tool developed by Yihui Xi which makes our lives a whole lot easier to create, maintain and update our own blog. Its a bit of a trouble at start, but once you get going you come to see its effectiveness. 

Once we create our blog we can then choose to host it either on Github Pages or on Netlify.
