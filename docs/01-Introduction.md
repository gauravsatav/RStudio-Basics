# Introduction

Organisations collect data that they have gathered from customers, businesses, economy and practical experience. Data is then processed after gathering and is categorised as per the requirement and analysis is done to study purchase patterns and etc.

It has always been important to know ones customer and have an understanding of the market one is operating in, but it has only been in recent years that we've experience a tremendous acceleration in the rate of data generation.

The idea is to make sense of the data you have, to analyse it and share better business prospects in the near future and how youâ€™re going to do it, is with the concepts of analytics. It is the science of extracting trends, patterns and useful information from a set of existing data which will be of no use if not analysed. It is a kind of business intelligence that is now used for gaining profits and making better use of resources. This can also help in improving managerial operations and leverage organisations to next level.

If not analysed this data is going to get wasted whereas if analysed properly this data can help us in finding information that is powerful to bring in a change in the patterns of how business is already working or going.
