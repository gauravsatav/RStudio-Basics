# Setting up a Project

Before we start with our analysis, we'll start off by setting up a project. Setting up a project helps us in the following ways

- Keeping track of all the files and variables which are created in between our executions. 
- It also helps us to reproduce our work and keep a track of all the libraries upon which our code relies upon (see [`packrat`](https://github.com/rstudio/packrat)).
- It allows us to enable version control.
